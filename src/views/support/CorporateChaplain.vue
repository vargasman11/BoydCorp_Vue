      <div class="container col-sm-12 col-md-10"><p>A long-standing principle belief for Boyd Bros is to recognize our
        people are our most valuable asset. In living this belief, Boyd Bros has long sought to provide benefits that
        reach beyond providing a paycheck or simply providing a place to work. This is why Boyd Bros provides a Chaplain
        Assistance Program (CAP) through Corporate Chaplains of America. Many people are familiar with hospital or
        military chaplains, but most are not aware of the tremendously positive impact chaplains are having in the
        workplace. CCA is headquartered in Wake Forest, NC and is a non-profit organization whose work is
        non-denominational, and non-sectarian. They care for all employees regardless of race, creed, color or religious
        preference.</p>
        <p>CCA has a wonderful track record in our industry caring for people with personal, family, or crisis
          difficulties. One leader in our industry recently remarked, “Over the last six years our chaplains at the
          various terminals have assisted our employees through crisis after crisis. The chaplaincy program has exceeded
          all of my original expectations.” We are glad to having someone who: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visits the workplace at least once a week.</li>
          <li>Is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year for help during a crisis.</li>
          <li>Will share our difficulties on a confidential basis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Boyd Bros’ Chaplain, Gaylon Benton, is a resident of Birmingham, and is primarily based at the Birmingham
          terminal; however, Gaylon is only a phone call away for any of our drivers, non-drivers, or their families.
          One of the great benefits of Corporate Chaplains is their availability, 24/7, backed up by a commitment to
          return your phone call within 15 minutes, day or night. Gaylon can be reached via phone at <a
              href="tel:8773222427">(877) 322-2427</a> ext. 4036.</p>
        <p> Boyd Bros is proud to be able to offer what few companies of any kind provide for their workforce: the
          comfort of knowing there is someone always available to help us with personal needs, in confidence, available
          24 hours a day, seven days a week. This is just another way that Boyd Brothers displays…Boyd cares! </p>

            <p>And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty
              left over to share with others. As the scriptures say, “Godly people give generously to the poor. Their
              good deeds will never be forgotten.” For God is the one who gives seed to the farmer and then bread to
              eat. In the same way, he will give you many opportunities to do good, and he will produce a great harvest
              of generosity in you. Yes, you will be enriched so that you can give even more generously. And when we
              take your gifts to those who need them, they will break out in thanksgiving to God.</p>
