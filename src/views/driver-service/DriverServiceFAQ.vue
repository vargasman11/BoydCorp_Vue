          <p><b>How do I request vacation pay and how much will I be paid?</b></p>
          <p>Drivers are eligible for 1 week vacation pay on or after the 1st pay period after they have reached their 1
            year anniversary. It is paid at 1% of the previous twelve months gross earnings, which is the equivalent of
            1 week. After completing 3 years of service, the driver is eligible for 2% of the previous 12 months gross
            earnings which is the equivalent of 2 weeks vacation. In order to get paid for vacation after reaching
            eligibility, the driver must request to be paid through his driver manager. The driver manager would then
            have to turn in a pay sheet to the payroll department and this would be keyed in to process in the following
            payroll.</p>
